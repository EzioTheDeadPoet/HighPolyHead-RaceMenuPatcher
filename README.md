# HighPolyHead-RaceMenuPatcher

A Patcher to patch Racemenu relevant Records to support High Poly Head exclusively removing Vanilla assets from the Racemenu

This Tool patches racemenu relevant records to use High Poly Head records instead of their equivalent vanilla Records for character creation, making the default presets use the High Poly Head parts.
And it disables all their vanilla equivalent parts for character creation to prevent the use of the replaced parts.

Before running make sure you haven't used a similar patcher to automatically alter your race-headparts since having edits like that on your loadorder will break the patcher.

big thanks to @JanuarySnow they wrote the 1st version of this based on my initial knowledge on how presets work. 
the original patcher can be found [here](https://github.com/JanuarySnow/hph_replacer) for reference.
